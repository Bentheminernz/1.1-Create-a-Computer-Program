# This is my assessment entry for NCEA 1.1 Create a Computer Program

If you're downloading anything from 15-03 (15th of March) onwards, make sure you download both Assessment.py and quiz_dictionaries.py otherwise it will NOT work.

Ensure you are using Python 3.11.6 or earlier and have the Pick package installed for this to work. If they aren't present the program will provide a tutorial on how to install and is tailored to either Windows or Mac depending on what platform the code is being run from. :)
